# Several main windows (⌘N)

Arc's behavior is in `arc-reference.md` §6 "Multiple windows". In short: every window shows the same sidebar (spaces, favorites, pinned and Today tabs); each window has its own space, selected tab, split view and sidebar visibility; ⌘N opens a window on the current space with nothing selected and the command bar open; every window comes back after a relaunch.

## Design

**One controller, several windows.** The main `Browser` (`src/main/browser.ts`) keeps owning the store, the profiles, the live tabs and the Little Arc windows. Each main window is a `Win` (in `browser.ts`): its `MainWindow` (sidebar UI, overlay), the runtime state that used to sit on `Browser` (Peek, sidebar peek and its watcher, tab drag, Ctrl+Tab switcher, full-screen tab, current layout), and a persisted `WindowView`. Incognito windows stay separate controllers, as before.

**`WindowView`** (`PersistedState.windows`, in `state.json`) holds what is per window: `activeSpaceId`, the selected tab of each space (`selected`), each space's splits (`splits`), `sidebarVisible`, and the window's bounds and maximized state. `window.json` (the old single window's bounds) is read once, for the first window.

**The current window.** The existing code reads `state.activeSpaceId`, `space.activeItemId`, `space.splits` and `settings.sidebarVisible`. Those fields now always hold the *current* window's values: `use(win)` copies them into the old current window's `WindowView` and the new window's values into the state (`captureView` / `applyView` in `src/main/window-state.ts`). Everything that acts on "the window" therefore keeps working unchanged. The current window changes when a window gets focus, sends IPC (sidebar or overlay), gets a key press, or when one of its pages (or its Peek) raises an event. Menu commands act on the focused window. Timers (the sidebar-peek watcher) act on their own window and switch back after.

The UI of every other window gets `stateForView(state, view)`: the same shared state with that window's space, selections, splits and sidebar visibility laid over it, so the renderer needs no change to read it.

**A page lives in one window.** A tab's `WebContentsView` can only be in one window. Like Arc, a tab can be selected in two windows; the window that lays it out (the focused one) takes the view. The other window marks the pane `elsewhere` and shows a still image of the page (`capturePage`, sent on `IPC.snapshot`); clicking it, or focusing that window, takes the page back.

**Closing and quitting.** Closing a window with others still open drops its `WindowView` and keeps its tabs running for the other windows. Closing the last one keeps its `WindowView` (macOS keeps running; the next window, from the Dock or a menu, reopens with that view); on Windows and Linux the app quits as before. On quit (`before-quit`) nothing is dropped, so every open window is restored at the next launch, the last focused one on top.

**New window.** ⌘N / Ctrl+N (`newWindow` in `keymap.ts`), File › New Window, the macOS Dock menu (first item) and the Windows jump list (`--new-window`). The window cascades from the current one, shows the current window's space with no tab selected, the sidebar shown, and opens the command bar. From an incognito window it opens a normal window.

**Not done.** Extensions see a tab in the window it was first created in (`electron-chrome-extensions` keeps the window it got at `addTab`). The Ctrl+Tab recent-tab order is shared by all windows. Arc's per-window sidebar width and expanded folders stay global.
